Built on the Texture Pack Template by EmiHead.



This skin replaces the 2x textures in 2x detail. Most importantly, the redesigned numerals on the standard cards are clearer and easier to read. I have found that the game normally uses the 2x textures for everything except for the planets, Soul, and most of the spectrals. I'm just an artist and don't know if the mod could be coded to force 2x on everything, so I left the planets alone, and the way this sets them apart is easy to get used to. The refinements to the jokers and tarot stay mostly faithful to the original art, but I took more liberties with the lettering, giving more variety to the word JOKER, differentiating them with different type styles to fit the themes. Various deliberate choices are made to improve clarity for the play experience: For instance, it was nearly impossible to tell a red stake sticker from an orange stake sticker by color, so I added some green stripes to the orange. And because it had been so easy to mistake Astronomer for other jokers, he's now dressed more like Carl Sagan. Stuff like that. Enjoy vanilla Balatro with sharper vision! It's like having new glasses! --CeruleanKay
